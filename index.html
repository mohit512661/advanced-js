        Whenever javascript code is run, a global execution context is created.
      </li>
      <li class="sub1">
        You can refer to "this" or "window" keyword to see what global execution
        context offers.
      </li>
      <li class="sub1">
        Execution context happens in two phases
        <ul>
          <li class="sub2">
            MEMORY CREATION PHASE - javascript engine skims through the script
            and store variables and functions in its memory, so variables are
            stored in memory and are assigned a special placeholder called
            undefined whereas in case of functions, complete function is stored.
            - this phenomena is called hoisting in javascript.
          </li>
          <li class="sub2">
            EXECUTION PHASE - javascript now starts to run the code line by line
            and starts to assign values as it encounters one.
          </li>
